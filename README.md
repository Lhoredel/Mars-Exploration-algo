# Mars-Exploration-algo
This code solves the Mars Exploration problem by examining a transmitted SOS message that might have been corrupted. It processes the string in groups of three characters and compares each position to the expected "SOS" pattern to find any changes. The algorithm counts all character mismatches by verifying if each position has the correct letter from the SOS sequence.
